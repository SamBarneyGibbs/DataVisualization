Sam's first repository
## Hi! My name is Sam Barney-Gibbs. Iâ€™ve spent a majority of my life in Southern California, but I was born in New Jersey with my twin sister and raised by two fantastic moms. I like to write across genres, play tennis, cook/bake, and watch an excessive amount of tv. My friends would call me detail-oriented, multifaceted, and compassionate, but I would call myself arguably obssessive, moody, and maybe even a people-pleaser. 
## I will be a junior at Lehigh University (class of 2024). I declared majors in journalism and political science and minors in philosophy and global studies. Currently, I am part of the Eckardt Scholar Honors Program, will be the news editor for The Brown and White newspaper, am a TRAC Fellow, intern for the Office of UN Programs, and am a club tennis team member.
## I hope to use my education and innate drive to be a hell-raising force in the journalistic world to educate, inform, and move the public to make important decisions, feel important emotions, and be better people for the worldly knowledge they obtain.

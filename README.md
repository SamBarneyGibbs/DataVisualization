Sam's first repository
## My name is Sam Barney-Gibbs, and Iâ€™m from Southern California but am a junior (class of 2024) at Lehigh University. I declared majors in journalism and political science and minors in philosophy and global studies. Currently, I am part of the Eckardt Scholar Honors Program, will be the news editor for The Brown and White newspaper, am a TRAC Fellow, intern for the Office of UN Programs, and am a club tennis member. I like to write across genres, play tennis, cook/bake, and watch an excessive amount of tv.
